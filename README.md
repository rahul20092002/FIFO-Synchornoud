# FIFO-Synchornoud
This Verilog module implements a synchronous FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer. It is designed for data storage and retrieval in systems where both read and write operations share the same clock domain. The module handles overflow and underflow conditions, ensuring reliable data management.
